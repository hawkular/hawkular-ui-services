[.lead]
*Hawkular UI Services* is the home of Angular UI services, such as ngResources and other utility services that can be used across Hawkular UI Modules(plugins). These UI plugins comprise the Hawkular console for https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular[Hawkular].  This console is based on https://github.com/hawtio/hawtio/blob/master/docs/Overview2dotX.md[Hawt.io 2], which a javascript based client-side framework. The various directories underneath console directory are Hawt.io 2 plugins and the various plugins eventually compose a Hawkular console. This modular approach to creating hawtio console plugins allows us to create individual plugins that comprise a console or can easily  be plugged into other Hawtio based consoles. The plugin system makes it easy to add/remove functionality (even dynamically).



To build the service:

```shell
npm install
bower install
gulp
```

The service can be tested with the server. To run the actual testsuite you need to have relevant (that means hawkular-metrics,
hawkular-inventory, ...) server running on localhost on port 8080. It must have a clean database (= no tenants, no metrics, ...).
Once the server is up and running, execute the relevant rest sub-target:

```shell
gulp rest:inventory
gulp rest:metric
```

to start the testsuite.
